Welcome to python-odata's documentation!
========================================

What is this?
-------------

A simple library to consume an OData 4.0 endpoint. For example, an endpoint
created with Microsoft's WebAPI 2.2. This library exposes the OData entities
in a manner that mimics some of the modern ORM libraries for easy usage.

Features:

- Supports OData version 4.0 with JSON format
- Supports automatic reflection of types from $metadata endpoint
- Supports counting, creating, reading, updating and deleting data
- Supports simple queries on EntitySets
- Powered by the excellent Requests library
- Most of the more intricate querying options
- Automatically generate Python data classes based on service $metadata endpoint definitions

Not currently supported:

- ATOM format
- ComplexTypes
- Streams
- Python naming convention for data classes

Code example
------------

Connecting to a service and building entity classes from the service's metadata:

.. code-block:: python

   from odata import ODataService
   url = 'http://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/'
   Service = ODataService(url, reflect_entities=True)

Fetch the Order entity from reflected classes:

.. code-block:: python

    Order = Service.entities['Order']

Query some orders:

.. code-block:: python

    query = Service.query(Order)
    query = query.filter(Order.Name.startswith('Demo'))
    query = query.order_by(Order.ShippedDate.desc())
    for order in query:
        print(order.Name)

More advanced example:

.. code-block:: python

    OrderDetails = service.entities["Order_Details"]

    query = service.query(OrderDetails)
    values = query \
        .filter((OrderDetails.Order.Employee.HomePhone.contains("555")) | (OrderDetails.Order.Employee.City == "London")) \
        .filter(OrderDetails.Order.Employee.FirstName.lacks("Steven")) \
        .order_by(OrderDetails.Order.ShipCountry.asc()) \
        .all()
    for order_details in values:
        service.values(order_details)
        service.values(order_details.Order)
        service.values(order_details.Order.Employee)
